# Smart-Traffic-System-YOLO-BEV_ASEP2
Real-time traffic density &amp; smart signal system using YOLO and BEV

IMPQ : These are the instructions for further my team members go through the readme i have made and you will get what what to do 

# 🚦 Smart Traffic Monitoring System (YOLO + SORT + BEV + Heatmap)   (till now this much progress is done by pk2807)

A computer vision-based traffic analysis system that detects, tracks, and counts vehicles using YOLOv8 and SORT.  
It also provides traffic density estimation and heatmap visualization.

## 📁 Dataset / Videos

⚠️ Videos are not included in this repository due to large file size.

Download videos from:
👉 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tQHxOUryJvcnEer81LOL6YC8mtuKzNF8

After downloading, place them inside the `data/` folder and rename exactly as:

traffic_main.mp4  
traffic_test.mp4

## 🚀 Features

- Vehicle Detection using YOLOv8  
- Multi-object Tracking using SORT  
- Unique Vehicle Counting (Line Crossing)  
- Region of Interest (ROI) filtering  
- Bird’s Eye View (BEV) transformation  
- Traffic Density Detection (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)  
- Heatmap Visualization
